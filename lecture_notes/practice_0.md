Python3 is the language we will be using.

If you need to learn Python, I suggest starting here:

## Libraries and tools

### Jupyter

Jupyter is browser based development environment. It supports a couple of languages, but is mainly used for Python and R. 

A quick tutorial can be found here: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/

Instead of installing locally, we can use cloud based notebook solutions. I recommend using [Microsoft Azure Notebook](https://notebooks.azure.com). 

### Most common Data science libraries

- __numpy__ Matrix, Vector operations. Lots of other mathemathical operations. https://numpy.org/
- __pandas__ Data operation on Tabular and Serial data. https://pandas.pydata.org
- __sklearn__ Machine Learning library. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/
- __matplotlib__ Visualization library. https://matplotlib.org/
